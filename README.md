The [tldr pages](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr) project is a collection of community-maintained help pages for command-line tools, that aims to be a simpler, more approachable complement to traditional man pages.

Maybe you are new to the command-line world? Or just a little rusty? Or perhaps you can't always remember the arguments to lsof, or tar?

It certainly doesn't help that the first option explained in man tar is:
```
-b blocksize
Specify the block size, in 512-byte records, for tape drive I/O.
```

This app is just that: an ever-growing collection of examples for the most common UNIX, Linux, macOS, SunOS and Windows command-line tools.
